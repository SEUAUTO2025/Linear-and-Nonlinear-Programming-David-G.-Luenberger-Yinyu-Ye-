这是大三优化方法（全英）第一节课上老师给的参考资料中的一本书，看起来偏向建模的习题偏多，符合我们的考试方向。网上没找到题解，我会在这个仓库里传一传自己做过的题，如果有做过的大佬，可以指出我解答过程中的错误或是上传其他题解！
This is one of the reference books provided by the instructor during the first session of the Junior-Year Optimization Methods (All-English) course. It appears to contain a higher proportion of modeling-oriented exercises, aligning well with our exam focus. I haven't found any solutions online yet, so I'll upload my own worked-out problems to this repository. 
If any experts have solved these problems, please feel free to point out errors in my solutions or upload alternative solutions!
